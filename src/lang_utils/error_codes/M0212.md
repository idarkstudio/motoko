# M0212

This warning means that you are affixing a parenthetical note to a message send (i.e. either
a canister method call of a self-send with `async`, or `actor`) that contains an attribute not recognised
by this version of the Motoko compiler.

Currently, only these attributes are recognized in parenthetical notes:

For _message_ sends and `async` expressions
- `cycles : Nat`
- `timeout : Nat32`

For `actor` and `actor  class` declarations:
- `migration : {<old-fields>} -> {<current-fields>}`
